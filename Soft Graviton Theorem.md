A [[Soft Theorems]] for gravitons.
# Leading Order
Calculated by Weinberg in 1965. Connected to [[Gravitational Memory Effect]] via Fourier transform.
See [lectures by Andrew Strominger](chrome-extension://bomfdkbfpdhijjbeoicnfhjbdhncfhig/view.html?mp=4LQgfu8l) for derivation.

# Subleading Order
Connected to [[Gravitational Spin Memory Effect]].
See [paper by Cachazo and Strominger](chrome-extension://bomfdkbfpdhijjbeoicnfhjbdhncfhig/view.html?mp=Vimo2QAk) for derivation.
