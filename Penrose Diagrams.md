The Penrose diagram, also known as a conformal diagram, is a method of representing global spacetimes in a diagram using conformal transformations to pull all of space into a finite region that diverges at the boundaries. Distances are not faithfully represented in Penrose diagrams, but the causal structure is unaffected. This makes them incredibly useful for studying the behavior of spacetime at its boundary, such as in the study of [[Asymptotic Symmetry]].

See [[Finite Conformal Transformations (dâ‰¥3)]] for a discussion on conformal transformations.

This fact is why conformal transformations make for an elegant way to represent the causal structure of global spacetimes.
