Many-body physics is the general study of determining macroscopic phenomena from microscopic quantities for very large systems of (quasi-)particles. In these cases, solving the Schrodinger equation becomes exponentially difficult, and it is often necessary to rely on more sophisticated computational methods and approximation schemes.

Some common methods include: Monte Carlo sampling, tensor networks, exact diagonalization, and density functional theory.

Some classes of many-body theories include high-temperature superconductors, the fractional quantum Hall effect, etc.

Many-body methods are not necessary for theories that admit effective single-quasiparticle descriptions, such as electron conduction in most metals and semiconductors.

These days, [[Machine Learning|machine learning]] has become an especially attractive method for solving many-body systems. Machine learning specializes in extracting features from granular data, it can be imagined that the data is microscopic information such as microstates and the features are macroscopic quantities such as those describing phases.
