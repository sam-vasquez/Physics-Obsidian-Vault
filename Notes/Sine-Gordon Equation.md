Frenkel-Kontorova Model
The FK model reduces to the sine-Gordon equation in the continuum limit approximation.

sine-Gordon models are [[Exactly Solvable Models]].

The [[Solitons]] of the sine-Gordon equation are boson duals of the fermions in the massive [[Thirring Model]]. [[Bosonization]].

The sine-Gordon equation is Lorentz invariant.
