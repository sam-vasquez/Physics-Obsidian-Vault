Soft theorems characterize universal properties of Feynman diagrams and scattering amplitudes when a massless external particle has its energy taken to zero.



# Soft Brehmstrahlung
# Several Soft Particles

# Memory Effects
Soft theorems typically concern the momentum space poles in scattering amplitudes. Remarkably, under a Fourier transform of the momentum space pole, it can be shown to have the same expression as that of the DC shift in asymptotic data between late and early times that characterizes the memory effect. These are naturally equivalent because the Fourier transform of a pole in frequency space is a step function in time. 

# Ward Identities of Asymptotic Symmetries
Every symmetry has a Ward identity that equates scattering amplitudes of symmetry-related states, and can be derived as the vanishing of all matrix elements of the associated charge conservation laws. The Ward identities for [[Asymptotic Symmetry]]ies turn
